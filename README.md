OSU CASCADES COUNSELING CLINIC INTAKE SYSTEM

Project for CS 361

This project is designing and creating a web based program to collect and store
data for the OSU Cascades counseling clinic. Having the data collection and storage
be digital will increase the speed in which information can be organized and processed
as well as reducing the amount of paper used.

TEAM ONE: Jack, Justin, Tim, Kyleen
