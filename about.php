    		<p>Oregon State University - Cascades offers free counseling to community members through the university’s graduate counseling clinic. The counseling sessions provide a community service and allow master’s students to implement and develop expertise under the close supervision of faculty and clinical supervisors.

			Sessions are facilitated by graduate students who are trained in cognitive–behavioral therapies that are shown to be effective in helping individuals manage stress, anxiety, depression and trauma.

			Community counseling is offered in Bend at the Graduate & Research Center near the Old Mill District.</p>
